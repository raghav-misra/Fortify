### An App Created for the COVID-19 Code Jam! 

I teamed up with @LehuyH to create an app to help slow the spread of the Coronavirus

## What is Fortify? 

Fortify is a self-care app on the web that promotes effective handwashing and actvities that practices social distancing. Let's face it, a lot of us don't wash our hands enough or even correctly. It is important more than ever that we ALL make an effort to slow the spread of the virus, and one of the most easiest ways to do this it to make sure our hands are clean. With Fortify you can keep track of how and when you wash your hands anytime! Additionally, **Fortify** can help you practice social distancing by keeping track of your daily activities. 

Can you reach a **100%** Safety Score everyday? Make a profile to find out! 

## Features 

Our original concept was to create something to track washing our hands, but since then we expanded on the concept to include other tools. This includes: 
 - List item
 - Social distancing activities
 - Scheduler
 - COVID-19 FAQs and facts
 - COVID-19 News 

## How Do I Use Fortify? 

Fortify works on any browser but best in phones as they are the most portable device(s). The app will guide you through the basic functionalities. Just be sure to actively log progress every time! 

## Tech Used:

### Frontend:
- HTML, CSS, and ES6 (obviously)
- Web Components
- We challenged ourselves to write our own data binding mechanisms, and SPA routing, and it paid off! 

### Backend:
- NodeJS, 
- ExpressJS, and...
- MongoDB

## Feedback/Suggestions Much Appreciated!!

Enjoy, and upvote!!# Fortify
